 Represents the result of a `Tile` search,
 
 The result can indicate one of three things.
 
 - There is a valid tile at the adjacent location (`TileResult.tile` will be non-nil and `TileResult.isInsideGrid` will be `true`)
 - There is a space at the adjacent location (`TileResult.tile` will be nil and `TileResult.isInsideGrid` will be `true`)
 - The adjacent location is outside the dimensions of the grid (`TileResult.tile` will be nil and `TileResult.isInsideGrid` will be `false`)
